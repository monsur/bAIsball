plAI ball is a baseball podcast generated by AI! I created this project to mess
around and learn more about different AI APIs.

## Flow
- Downloads and saves HTML from the previous day's boxscores.
- Merges the boxscores into a single prompt file.
- Send the prompt to AI to generate the podcast transcript.
- Use the AI TTS API to convert the transcript into an MP3.

## Code
Source lives in the podcaster/src directory. I used cursor.com to get the
initial code bootstrapped, but then I ran out of quota so I made a bunch of
refactorings myself.

## Examples
Visit the examples/ directory for examples of the transcript and podcast.

And of course, that logo was generated using Gemini!
