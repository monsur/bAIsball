Welcome to "Play Ball!" I'm kAIrl, bringing you the latest highlights from Major League Baseball games played on May 1, 2025. Let's dive right into the action from around the league.

The Detroit Tigers took on the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim, California, and what a night it was for the Tigers! They rallied to a 10-4 victory over the Angels, improving their record to an American League-best 20-12. Dillon Dingler was the star of the show, capping a five-run eighth inning with a three-run homer. Javier Báez and Gleyber Torres each contributed solo homers in the third inning, and Spencer Torkelson added a two-run shot in the ninth. Tigers starter Casey Mize pitched seven solid innings, allowing four runs and striking out four. The Angels, meanwhile, suffered their sixth straight loss, and star outfielder Mike Trout was placed on the 10-day injured list with a bone bruise in his surgically repaired left knee. A key defensive play came from Báez, who robbed Jorge Soler of a home run with a leaping catch. The Tigers' offense was relentless, especially in the late innings, turning the game around with timely hits and capitalizing on Angels' errors.

Over in Philadelphia, the Washington Nationals edged out the Philadelphia Phillies 4-2, avoiding a three-game sweep. Rookie Brad Lord earned his first major league win, pitching five strong innings with four strikeouts. Luis Garcia Jr. was instrumental at the plate, singling, doubling, and driving in a run. The Nationals' big sixth inning, which included an RBI single by Garcia and a double steal, turned the tide after the Phillies had taken an early 1-0 lead on an Alec Bohm RBI single. Phillies starter Taijuan Walker pitched well through five innings but faltered in the sixth. Trea Turner led the Phillies with three hits, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Nationals' timely offense.

In Chicago, the White Sox dominated the Milwaukee Brewers 8-0 at Rate Field. Sean Burke pitched six shutout innings, allowing just two hits and striking out five. The White Sox offense was led by Luis Robert Jr., who drove in four runs, and Miguel Vargas, who blasted a three-run homer in the sixth. The Brewers' starter Chad Patrick took the loss, giving up three runs on six hits. The White Sox bullpen was flawless, with Mike Vasil, Brandon Eisert, and Jared Shuster combining for three innings of no-hit relief. A highlight defensive play came early when Robert Jr. robbed Rhys Hopkins of a grand slam with a leaping catch at the wall.

The Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Mets 4-2 at Citi Field, handing the Mets a rare home series loss. Juan Soto hit two home runs for the Mets, his first at Citi Field as a Met, but it wasn't enough. Zac Gallen pitched six strong innings for Arizona, allowing just one run and striking out eight. The Diamondbacks got homers from Geraldo Perdomo and Tim Tawa, and key RBI from Alek Thomas and Eugenio Suárez. The Mets' offense was limited despite Soto's power display, and their franchise-record streak of 10 straight home series wins came to an end.

The Kansas City Royals swept the Tampa Bay Rays with an 8-2 win in Tampa, Florida. Bobby Witt Jr. extended his hitting streak to 22 games with a two-run homer and three RBIs. Seth Lugo pitched six solid innings, allowing two runs and striking out five. Vinnie Pasquantino contributed with a single and a double, driving in two runs. The Rays' offense was led by Yandy Díaz, who hit a solo homer in the first inning, and Jonathan Aranda with an RBI single in the sixth. Rays starter Shane Baz struggled, giving up seven runs in just under six innings.

At PNC Park, the Chicago Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-3. The Cubs' offense exploded in the fifth inning with home runs from Dansby Swanson, Kyle Tucker, and Seiya Suzuki. Suzuki added another two-run homer in the seventh. Cubs starter Colin Rea earned the win, pitching six innings and allowing two runs. Pirates starter Paul Skenes had a rough outing, lasting only five innings and walking four batters. The game was played under a somber mood following a fan's accident at the ballpark the previous night.

In Toronto, the Blue Jays rallied to beat the Boston Red Sox 4-2. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a go-ahead three-run homer in the eighth inning, while Daulton Varsho added a solo shot in the seventh. Toronto trailed 2-0 through six innings but came back behind strong pitching from José Berríos and Mason Fluharty. Red Sox starter Tanner Houck pitched seven innings, allowing just one run, but took the loss. The Blue Jays won back-to-back games for the first time since mid-April.

The Cleveland Guardians edged the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in a thrilling 10-inning game at Progressive Field. José Ramírez made history by becoming the first player in franchise history with 250 career home runs and 250 steals. He also scored the winning run in the 10th inning after a clutch single and a steal of second base. The Twins rallied late in the game, scoring two runs in the seventh inning aided by defensive miscues from the Guardians. Kolby Allard earned the win in relief, and the Guardians took three of four in the series.

The Oakland Athletics shut out the Texas Rangers 3-0 at Globe Life Field. Jeffrey Springs pitched six scoreless innings, allowing just two hits. Jacob Wilson and Miguel Andujar each had two hits and an RBI. The Athletics scored early and added insurance runs in the seventh and eighth innings. The Rangers have now gone seven straight games without a home run, matching a drought from 2021, and have been shut out four times this season. Tyler Mahle took the loss, allowing one run in six innings.

At Great American Ball Park, the Cincinnati Reds routed the St. Louis Cardinals 9-1 in a rain-delayed game. Jose Trevino hit a two-run homer early, and Spencer Steer added a solo shot later. The Reds scored multiple runs in the second and seventh innings, with Santiago Espinal contributing a two-run single. Reds reliever Graham Ashcraft was dominant, retiring nine straight batters. Cardinals starter Matthew Liberatore struggled before being replaced by Matt Svanson, who allowed the Reds to extend their lead.

Finally, the Colorado Rockies rallied to defeat the San Francisco Giants 4-3 at Oracle Park, snapping a 12-game losing streak at that venue. Jordan Beck hit a tying double in the eighth, followed by Hunter Goodman's go-ahead single. Rockies starter Kyle Freeland pitched six innings, allowing three runs. Giants starter Justin Verlander, still seeking his first win with San Francisco, gave up two runs in 6 1/3 innings. The Giants have now lost three straight games.
