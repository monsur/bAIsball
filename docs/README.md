plAI ball is a baseball podcast generated by AI! I created this project to mess
around with AI.

## Flow
- Downloads and saves HTML from the previous day's boxscores.
- Merges the boxscores into a single prompt file.
- Send the prompt to AI to generate the podcast transcript.
- Use the AI TTS API to convert the transcript into an MP3.
- Upload the podcast, transcript, and intermediate files to Amazon S3.
- Update and publish the RSS feed.

## Code
Source lives in the [podcaster/src](https://github.com/monsur/plAI-ball/tree/main/podcaster/src)
directory. Each of the steps above is encapsulated in a different source file. I used
[cursor.com](https://cursor.com) to get the initial code bootstrapped, but then
I ran out of quota so I made a bunch of refactorings myself.

## Examples
Visit the [examples/](https://github.com/monsur/plAI-ball/tree/main/example)
directory for examples of the transcript and podcast.

And of course, that logo was generated using Gemini!
